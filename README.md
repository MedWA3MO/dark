Darkly is one of the **42 cybersecurity projects** where you explore a vulnerable web application inside a virtual machine and **hunt flags** by exploiting its weaknesses. This README will help you (and others) get started, from downloading the ISO to accessing the web app and troubleshooting common issues.

---

## üì• 1. Download the ISO

* Go to your **42 Intra** (intranet).
* Navigate to the **Darkly project page**.
* Download the file:

  ```
  Darkly_i386.iso
  ```

  *(it‚Äôs usually provided in the resources section)*

---

## üíª 2. Run the ISO in QEMU (no VirtualBox required)

If you don‚Äôt want to use VirtualBox, you can run it directly with **QEMU**.

Install QEMU:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update && sudo apt install qemu-system -y

# Arch
sudo pacman -S qemu-full

# Mac (Homebrew)
brew install qemu
```

Then boot Darkly:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom Darkly_i386.iso -m 1024 \
  -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::8080-:80
```

If you're using your own laptop, run it as root: 

```bash
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom Darkly_i386.iso -m 1024 -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::8080-:80
```

Explanation:

* `-cdrom Darkly_i386.iso` ‚Üí load the ISO as a virtual CD-ROM
* `-m 1024` ‚Üí allocate 1GB RAM
* `-nic user,hostfwd=tcp::8080-:80` ‚Üí forward host port `8080` ‚Üí VM port `80`

---

## üåê 3. Access the Darkly Website

Once the VM boots:

* Open your browser and go to:
  üëâ `http://localhost:8080`

This will show the vulnerable web application hosted inside Darkly.

## üê≠ Troubleshooting: QEMU grabs the mouse pointer (Linux host)

**Problem:** When QEMU launches, it captures (grabs) your mouse pointer and you cannot move the host cursor or switch out of the VM window easily.

**Quick fix (GUI QEMU/virt-manager / or QEMU window shortcuts on many distros):**

1. While the QEMU window is focused, press `Alt + v`.
2. Use the arrow keys to move down to the `Grab on hover` menu item.
3. Press `Enter` to **uncheck** `Grab on hover`.

After that, the VM window will no longer automatically grab the mouse pointer when you hover it, and you can move the cursor freely between your host and the VM.

**Alternative (general QEMU behavior):**

* Press the QEMU release key combination (commonly `Ctrl + Alt`) to release mouse/keyboard capture. This depends on your environment and QEMU frontend.

---

## üéØ 4. The Goal ‚Äì Hunt the Flags

Your mission is to:

* Explore the website.
* Find vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, weak auth, etc.).
* Collect **all the flags** hidden across the site.

‚ö†Ô∏è Remember: this environment is **intentionally vulnerable**. Never expose it to the internet!

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 5. Useful Notes & Extras

* If you prefer **VirtualBox**, just create a new VM and use `Darkly_i386.iso` as the boot disk.
* To forward **multiple ports** in QEMU (like SSH or HTTPS):

  ```bash
  qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom Darkly_i386.iso -m 1024 \
    -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::8080-:80,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22,hostfwd=tcp::8443-:443
  ```
* To stop the VM, close the terminal or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in the process terminal.

# [üõ°Ô∏è OWASP Top 10 ‚Äî 2021 Summary](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications:

---

## [üî¢ A01:2021 ‚Äî Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)
> **Moved up** from the fifth position.  
94% of applications were tested for some form of broken access control.  
The **34 CWEs** mapped to this category had more occurrences than any other.  

---

## [üîê A02:2021 ‚Äî Cryptographic Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/)
> Previously **Sensitive Data Exposure**.  
This category focuses on **cryptographic weaknesses** leading to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.  
It moves up one position to **#2**.  

---

## [üíâ A03:2021 ‚Äî Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)
> **Slides down** to the third position.  
94% of applications were tested for some form of injection.  
Now includes **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** under this category.  

---

## [üß† A04:2021 ‚Äî Insecure Design](https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/)
